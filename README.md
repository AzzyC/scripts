<h1>Welcome to AzzyC's Automation repository</h1>

	<b>Shell scripting averts tediousness from following the same mundane tasks on a machine, where human error or slowness is inevitable and will cost time.</b>
	<br>
	The fact that you can be away from the keyboard, knowing that the scripts are still progressing is greatly appreciated.
	<br>
	Bare in mind I am no shell script expert by any stretch, my mentality towards some of the solutions found in these scripts may not hold maximum efficiency but it is what I thought was reliable and easy for future manipulation.

<h2>bash scripts/gcloudvnc.sh</h2>

<p>
	<b>Prerequisites:</b>
	<br>
	<a href="https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/">VNC Viewer</a>
</p>

<p>
	All Users have a chance to $300 credits on Google Cloud Platform where they can loan machine(s) with a range of specs, with a respective cost on the credits, within a year span of the trial.
	<br>
	<b>However</b>, the created machines ('cloud instances') can only be accessed via Terminal, which may not be friendly for people who are used to a GUI Environment.
	<br><br>
	Therfore, <b>this script</b> will setup a VNC Server on the Google Cloud machine, whereby a GUI Ubuntu (Gnome) Desktop is setup for Users to access with a VNC Viewer.
